# ENA - Efficiency Network Analyser

This code was originally developed by Fabio Manganiello. He made it available at MATLAB Central: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4021-efficiency-network-analyser

I needed the ENA to illustrate the performance of multiple access protocols in my computer network classes. However, I had some problems with MATLAB 8.3 (R2014a) that is available in the laboratory of my university. ENA was originally developed for MATLAB 5.3 and so it presented some issues while running in a newer MATLAB. Additionally, ENA employed absolute screen resolution, which creates visualization problems.

I did some minor modifications in order to have ENA running in my system. However, it still has open issues, such as the 'hold on' function and the image generation that are not working. Thus, contributions are welcome.

Enjoy it! It is a nice software. Thanks, Fabio.
